## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Load dplyr

```{r}

##install.packages("dplyr") # do this only once!
library(dplyr) # do this every time I restart R and need dplyr!

```

## Load gapminder

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# install gapminder data
library(gapminder) #install.packages('gapminder') # do this only once!
str(gapminder)

```

## Exploration with gapminder

```{r}
# simple filter
filter(gapminder, lifeExp < 29)
filter(gapminder, country == "Rwanda")
a <- filter(gapminder, country %in% c("Rwanda", "Afghanistan"))

## compare without dplyr
gapminder[gapminder$lifeExp < 29, ]

# the pipe operator! %>%  (use command+shift+m on Mac or cntl+shift+map on PC)
## the %>%  or "then" or pipe operator takes whatever stuff is on the left and
## and passes it to the right as the first argument in the next stuff...the dataframe
## gets continuously changed and passed
# %>% is originally from magrittr package

gapminder %>% head
head(gapminder) #same as

gapminder %>% head(3)
head(gapminder, 3)

## subset with select()
select(gapminder, year, lifeExp)
gapminder %>% 
  select(year,lifeExp) %>% 
  head(4)

## mean gdp of Cambodia
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "Cambodia") %>% 
  select(country, year, pop, gdpPercap)

gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "Cambodia") %>% 
  select(-continent, -lifeExp) ## - means "not" this thing

#compare to base R
gapminder[gapminder$country =="Cambodia", c("country", "year", "pop", "gdpPercap")]

# continue with mutate
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap)

# exercise: add mutate to previous analysis

gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "Cambodia") %>% 
  select(-continent, -lifeExp) %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(mean_gdp = mean(gdp)) %>% 
  ungroup() # always ungroup if you group!

## with a for loop, for(country in all_countries){our analysis}

gapminder %>% 
  #filter(country == "Cambodia") %>% 
  select(-continent, -lifeExp) %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(mean_gdp = mean(gdp)) %>% 
  ungroup() # always ungroup if you group!

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
